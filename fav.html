        <h3>I love all types of pizzas, however, the Margherita pizza is the best in my opinion.  My favourite version is extra cheese with olives.  I love the taste of melted cheese in my mouth and, if possible I also eat leftover pizzas for breakfast.  An often recounted story holds that on June 11, 1889, to honour the Queen consort of Italy, Margherita of Savoy, the Neapolitan pizzamaker Raffaele Esposito created the "Pizza Margherita", a pizza garnished with tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil, to represent the national colours of Italy as on the Flag of Italy.  This is how Margherita pizzas were invented.  I thank Raffaele Esposito for inventing this dish, for I cannot live without it.
